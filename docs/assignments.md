# Assignments

> Weekly assignments are provided to the students for them to better understand, and also get their feet wet by to solve and practice what is being taught in the classes.

For weekly assignments we're using _**[GitHub Classroom](https://classroom.github.com/)**_, with which the instructors can easily evaluate the students' performance.
